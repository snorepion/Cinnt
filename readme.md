An array of string manipulation tools, ranging from fun (covfefeize) to useful (string to binary). It's pretty simple -- and small, so you can download it if you're having trouble figuring
out what it does. If you're having trouble figuring out how it *works*, it's probably because I hate commenting and therefore did zero to `null` to make it easy to understand. It's not
very complicated anyway, since I don't know very many advanced functions. Anyway, if you do find something you don't understand and have
a question, feel free to contact me through my website or at snorepion@gmail.com.

Features and whatnot:

Covfefeize (Example: coverage -> covfefe)

Garble set (Basically turns your input into gibberish and only allows it to be restored on PCs with the same garble dictionary installed. **Do not try to use this to circumvent password hacking!** It's very easy to get the original data from a settings file, so this will not deter any hackers who get into your file system to access the file your text is stored in in the first place. Online hackers won't be deterred either if you upload it and send it to someone else, since you also have to upload your dictionary to share it with them.)

Remove letters from the beginning of text (not the end yet)

Isolate specific text (Like find and replace, but you don't have to do all of the work of clicking the "Find Next" button!)

Subtract specific text (The opposite of the above - removes every instance of a specific string in your text)

Insert text [into a specific character position in your input]

Switch letter case between a multitude of options: uppercase, lowercase, sentence, reverse sentence (lIKE THIS), alternating between characters, and alternating between words (this one may not be completely precise)

Switch text between hex, human, and binary (in a convenient way - for example, if you translate TEST to hexadecimal, and then from hexadecimal to binary rather than from text to binary, you can convert from binary to text and get TEST without having to go through hex)

Reverse order of text (e.g. example to elpmaxe)

Create an anagram of text (e.g. example to plmxeae)

Automatically indent paragraphs

Sort list alphabetically and numerically

Reverse order of list

Shuffle items in list

Find using regex and plain text

Customizable UI
